    "After a sequencing experiment, the data is available as reads (representations of sections of nucleotides) and typically available in [fastq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format. The length of the reads and the quality of the assigned nucleotides depends largely on the processing steps and the technology used (Illumina, Nanopore, PacBio).\n",

    "Most of our analysis are done in a High Performance Computing cluster as most tools are resource intensive and performing analysis on your local computer would be too time consuming. The currently used cluster is **Compute Canada (CC cluster)**, you can login using the instructions available in the [wiki page for new users](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/SSH). \n",

Singularity containers are executed using the command `singularity run tool_image` or `singularity exec tool_image command`.

    "Our pipeline for quality control of raw reads includes several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use the ***seqkit*** tool to obtain basic statistics from the **.fastq** files. The module to load **seqkit** is available in CC, so it can be load using `module load`. \n",
    "    - The tool takes `fastq` files as inputs and produces a txt output \n",
    "2. We will use **fastqc** which is also available as a module in ComputeCanada. The tool creates an overall summary of different metrics of sequencing including nucleotide distribution, presence of repeats, quality of base calling, GC content and adapter content\n",
    "    - **fastqc** produces an output summary for every file entered\n",
    "3. Another tool (**multiqc**) takes all output summaries of **fastqc** in a directory and creates a nice single HTML output that can be visualized in any web browser.\n",
    "    - Not available in Compute Canada, so we use a singularity container to execute it\n",
    "4. To have reads ready for assembly, I trimm or remove any PCR adaptors, barcodes or poor quality regions using **BBtools**"
