    "Once we have analysis ready genomes (verified quality and lack of contamination), we can do annotation. The main goal of annotation is to identify the genomic features that are present in the contigs. There are many available tools to find these relevant sequences, and they mostly use predictive algorithms (recognition of common sequences in the DNA) or alignment against a reference database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most commonly used tools are [BAKTA](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta)  (https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000685) and the [NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline](https://github.com/ncbi/pgap) (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa1105). \n",
