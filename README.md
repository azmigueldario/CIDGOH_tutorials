# CIDGOH tutorials

Jupyter notebooks with tutorials for bioinformatics training in the Center for Infectious Diseases Genomics and One Health. Each notebook is executable in the institution cluster and reproduces common steps in most bacterial genomic analysis pipelines. It includes links to further references and training material.

Common processes in the group for microbial genomics isolate analysis include:

1. Quality control and filtering of raw reads
    - Appraisal of quality in sequencing results
    - Filtering of low quality regions
    - Trimming adapter sessions
    - Visualization of quality control
2. Assembly of draft genome
    - De-novo assembly (polishing of final fasta files)
    - Appraisal of quality in the resulting assembly
3. Genome annotation and downstream analysis
    - Annotation of genomic features using comprehensive databases
    - Define a matrix of genomic distances (SNP)
    - Produce a phylogenetic tree
